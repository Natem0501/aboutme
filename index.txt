# Nathan Meeker

I am a senior planning to graduate this May with a Bachelors of Science in Interactive 
Digital Media, Computer Science. I will also have finished all the requirements for 
my minor in General Business. 

I originate from Council Bluffs, IA. I went to Abraham Lincoln High School 
(yes, that really was the name of our school), and I enjoy playing sports or watching 
movies. As for prior experience, I worked for my parents' company for most of my life, 
until last year when I got an internship at a tech company called Riverside Technologies. 
I acted as a Computer Technician there over the summer. 

Since I am in my last semester before graduating, I was lucky enough to land a job in 
Overland Park, KS at an IT health company called Netsmart Technologies. The title of my 
position is a Delivery Analyst. This is the type of position I see myself fitting right 
in to, as I will be using both my communication/business skills and Computer Science 
skills. 

Something interesting about me is that I just about caught a 100-pound marlin in the 
Gulf of Mexico (after 15 minutes of reeling, the line snapped and he got away). Here

Nice to meet everyone!
