            <h2>Current</h2>
            I am a senior planning to graduate this May with a Bachelors of Science in Interactive 
            Digital Media, Computer Science. I will also have finished all the requirements for 
            my minor in General Business.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            I originate from Council Bluffs, IA. I went to Abraham Lincoln High School 
            (yes, that really was the name of our school), and I enjoy playing sports or watching 
            movies. As for prior experience, I worked for my parents' company for most of my life, 
            until last year when I got an internship at a tech company called Riverside Technologies. 
            I acted as a Computer Technician there over the summer.

            <h2>Plans</h2>
            Since I am in my last semester before graduating, I was lucky enough to land a job in 
            Overland Park, KS at an IT health company called Netsmart Technologies. The title of my 
            position is a Delivery Analyst. This is the type of position I see myself fitting right 
            in to, as I will be using both my communication/business skills and Computer Science 
            skills.

    Something interesting about me is that I just about caught a 100-pound marlin in the 
    Gulf of Mexico (after 15 minutes of reeling, the line snapped and he got away). Here 
    are some links to follow:
